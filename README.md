# Neighborhood-Info-UD989-Final-Project
Single page application featuring a map of neighborhood, with information functionality.


Using Yelp Fusion API to put up reviews of businesses that people select, based on if the place is a business or not. THis is proving out harder than expected, and I haven't fully configured them. This means that they will not be included on git right now. I also need to separate out my configs so that they are not loaded up on git.
