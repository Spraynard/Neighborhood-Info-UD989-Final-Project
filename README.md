# Neighborhood-Info-UD989-Final-Project
Single page application featuring a map of neighborhood, with information functionality.


Using Yelp Fusion API to put up reviews of businesses that people select, based on if the place is a business or not.

Harder than expected. Anyway, full functionality should be there, but the way that I got that functionality isn't really where I want it to be at all. 

Used fergalwalsh - PICO to make calls to the python backend that in turn made calls to the Yelp Fusion API.

Anyway, this program is now due for a refactor, since I pretty muched hacked till I got the answers I wanted.
